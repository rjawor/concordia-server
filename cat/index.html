	        Welcome to the interactive Concordia demo. The system finds the longest matches of the pattern sentence in its translation memory. This translation memory is 200 000 sentences taken from English-Spanish corpus of European Law. Please enter an English sentence in the field below and press Enter (or use the search button). This instance of Concordia works best with law sentences, but is very likely to output some results for any English sentence. You can also use predefined samples, simply use the link "show/hide samples" and apply one of the sample sentences.

	        Enjoy your work with the system!
